About me
Years ago I made a 4-player "House-hunting game" to help Geography students lean about GIS.
My day-job since April has been looking for a job.

Overview
Peaceful game, or at least no violence on screen.


Inspirations: grazing and wandering sheep, new level with fresh set of sheep, overhead 2D view, minimal violence.
Sorted differs: not attempting flocking AI, not copying realistic mechanism i.e. moving herder (dog or human) repels sheep.
