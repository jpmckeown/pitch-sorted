X Lost: woods, sheep randomly change direction
X Bounce: move in arc sideways (random L/R) slightly up and then down

14 July
+ how to comsine gotoXY and randomWalk i.e. travel down with some sideways wandering (and occasional upward reversals?)
+ sheep collision blocks movement (tried isOverlapPoint in spaceBattle code but quickly they stick together in small clumps)
+ if any background changes in-game, tiles better than bitmap
+ mouse control for Hat, use gotoX like in RTS
+ EditMode toggle what mouse currently does e.g. select a sheep and move it instantly somewhere; move tile in level design; etc

21 July
+ spin face, also wobble
+ fence around a protected tree (made png)
+ happy music until first sort, then ominous
+ at end of game (Quit cutscene) all sheep escape from pens, turn white, and happy music plays
+ "sorting hat is a purple herring"
+ ?adapt WindyBalloons, drop things on tres?
