## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle game. The player, a farmer, wants the sheep to reach the correct pen - like in the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog". Each level will have a tiled map designed using terrain types which differently affect sheep movement. The game is relaxed.

## Inspiration

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett [^1]

## Inspiration

"Animal Farm" by George Orwell

and the 2021 Nerial game

## Inspiration {background-image="img/red_blue_sheep.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: notes
On upland farms you often see sheep painted with different colours. This can signify various things, but one use is after assessing a sheep's quality. For example a farmer wants to identify ewes as fertile or barren. The infertile cannot stay in the flock and will be sold.

## Inspiration {background-image="img/smart-elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: notes
One at a time, to be assessed and painted sheep will go up into a clamp that holds them steady. High-end clamps have up and down ramps and this inspired the game mechanics beckon, paint, and drop.

![](img/sortingHat.jpg){.absolute left="920" top="480" width="225" height="225"}

::: notes
The player's icon symbolically represents the clamp and farmer combined. Placeholder art is a Sorting Hat because it reminds me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into one of the team houses.

## Prototype demo

## Game Vision

Novice videogame player not confused

Peaceful (at least, no violence on screen)

Relaxed pace

Overhead 2D

## Tutorial

Where is the player on screen?

What can I do? How is the game/level completed?

Where are the places that I need to move the sheep to?

## Game Look

![](img/sortingHat.jpg) ![](img/art_1.jpg)

Art: kids cartoon style

Palette: sonic-robo-blast-2-v22

## Tile set

Field: base tile

Deflect: right or left, maybe weak or strong

Halt: lake, sheep stops and grazes

Roam: sheep lose momentum and go into graze/wander mode

Unsort: mark covered up, magic? dust? girl with paintbrush?

## Trello board

## Level design roles

Level editing currently via number grid (like in Classic games)

Aiming for 9 levels

## Art roles

Sorting hat

Terrain tiles

## Visual fx roles

Sorting process (mystical & disorienting)

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

## Music roles

Placeholder music is "Sheep may safely graze" by JS Bach. This plays during menu and before sorting.

When sorting begins a switch to different music with a slightly ominous tone would be helpful.

## Sound fx roles

Cartoon style e.g. Shaun the Sheep

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

Sorting

Drop

Moving into terrain

## Code roles

The prototype is built on Chris DeLeon's Javascript tutorials, and will keep to that code style.

## Testing roles

Later levels especially need testing to see if they can be completed fairly easily.
