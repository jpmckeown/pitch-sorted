## Notes from slides

::: Inspiration {.notes}
On upland English farms you will see sheep painted with various colours. Often it marks ownership, but at some times of year after assessing sheep the shepherd might use paint to categorize, for example males not good enough to be working rams, or barren (infertile) females. Those cannot stay in the flock and must be sold for meat.

One at a time, sheep are evaluated and painted in a clamp. Some high-end clamps are elevated and this inspired a gameplay mechanism: sheep are beckoned up to the player icon, assigned to one of two categories, and then drop down to walk either to a pen or into a lorry or a truck. Once rightly penned they are "sorted".

::: {.notes}
Placeholder art includes a Sorting Hat because it reminded me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into a house or team. The player must align with sheep to beckon, then choose where to drop. Aim for correct pen but some terrain tiles will influence the sheep. Once all sheep are sorted and penned the next level begins with new sheep on different map.

Sorting sheep is tinged with sadness if the sort is for going to market. Later levels bring out the downside of sorting, for example a sheep may be marked with two colours (like Harry Potter being Slytherin) or terrain may change sheep colour, or a sheep may fluctuate between colours.

## Levels

Menu: animation hat pulls and sorts meeple, sends off diagonally

1: hat & 1 meeple only, drop to fall into pen (or try again)

2: hat & many meeples, pull & drop, score (progress when all sorted)

3: add 1 tutor, drop part-way, herd (attract by proximity)

4: add 2nd tutor, same mechanism but each only does one colour

5: add meeple random walk slow rare

6: add terrain, obstacles, deflectors, powerups

7: increase meeple random walk frequency

8: some sorting by Hat produces mixed meeples 

If a level is replayed mixed meeples appear.

How will it remember between games (keep record on device) or add mixed meeples from L3 onward.

first tutor is purple or striped blue/red

## Components

Brick = edge bounce, scoring,

Cars = goal detect, class, friction, facing/angle

Warrior = tutor move, 

Space = wandering AI, collision between objects

RTS = gotoXY, connector lines
