## Removed from pitch
"One man and his dog" BBC
X Lost: woods, sheep randomly change direction

## Music roles

When sorting begins a switch to different music with a slightly ominous tone would be helpful.

## Sound fx roles

## Code roles

The prototype is built on Chris DeLeon's Javascript tutorials, and will keep to that code style.

## Testing roles

Later levels especially need testing to see if they can be completed fairly easily.
