## Removed from pitch

X Lost: woods, sheep randomly change direction
X Bounce: move in arc sideways (random L/R) slightly up and then down

Placeholder music is "Sheep may safely graze" by JS Bach. This plays during menu and before sorting.

## Visual fx roles

Sorting process (mystical & disorienting)

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

## Music roles

When sorting begins a switch to different music with a slightly ominous tone would be helpful.

## Sound fx roles

Cartoon style e.g. Shaun the Sheep

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

Sorting

Drop

Moving into terrain

## Code roles

The prototype is built on Chris DeLeon's Javascript tutorials, and will keep to that code style.

## Testing roles

Later levels especially need testing to see if they can be completed fairly easily.
