# Update 11 September

Hi, this is Patrick with your Week 5 update for Sorted.

Sorted was derived from the Classic game Racing Cars. Its placeholder imagery has some legacy and this week's changes removed some of that

## Credits

Nicholas Polchies (device scaling code from APC5)

Chris DeLeon (ideas, including water in bottom row)

Patrick McKeown (integrate APC5 code, new grass tile, water-ditch tile, new goal graphics, 50 pixel grid, )

## New tile graphics

Grass placeholder was adapted from Racingcar road tile.
New grass made with Photopea noise and filters following steps provided by Chris DeLeon.
Pen placeholder derived from Racingcar victory goal tile.
New pen is drawn with Canvas graphics for flexibility. Currently on grass background but plan to swap in straw or mud background.

## Tiles expand from 40 to 50 pixels

Sheep were looking uncomfortably tight in new pens. Easier to make tiles bigger than sheep smaller, so the grid now uses tiles 50 pixel size.

## Scale to fit phone screen

On phone browsers (I tested three) the game field was cut off, losing the right edge, and lots of lower rows.

## APC5 - HomeTeam game with simple scaling

Chris DeLeon guided me to an earlier HomeTeam game APC or Accidental Personal Confusion 5 from 2017 because it has good scaling but avoids other complexities.

## Demo

## End

Summary: moved away from Racing Car game perhaps toward the Classic warrior adventure game (in tile size)

My plan, now the game fits on phone, is to make Hat movement respond better to taps on buttons on touch devices. I have an idea that Touch will work better with a slide move more like a warrior than a racing car.
