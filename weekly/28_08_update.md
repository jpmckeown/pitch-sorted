# Update 28 August

Hi, this is Patrick with your Week 3 update for Sorted.

Github 28 commits, trying to enable iPad to use buttons 

McFunkypants created a bunch of contributions this week.
First a tooltip tutorial that shows the keys used in gameplay.

Second a decal system to sprinkle small images around the play area. McFunkypants also made a variety of flowers and grass for the decals.

and McFunkypants third contribution was to make hoofprints appear behind each sheep as it roams.

H Trayford did some level-design.

I changed sheep head orientation to indicate when sheep is not free roaming i.e. when called, sent, or on fence out of play.

I made movement code for new tile type conveyor-belt.

Finally I added more tools to help designers, some Function keys, and also fixed some bugs. 

Let's go to a demo.
