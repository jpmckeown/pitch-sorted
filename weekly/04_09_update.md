# Update 4 Septemebr

Hi, this is Patrick and weekly update number 4 for Sorted.

Baaa, this week lots of different sheep soundfx contributed by McFunkypants. Also he wrote a function for ambient playing of baas and bleats randomly at low volume. Nice and realistic, Sounds like there's a field of sheep near you. Also when a sheep arrives at bottom of field at one of the goals, a loud baa sound. 

McFunkypants also added a dog barking soundfx.

And finally, a change to Y limit of decal flowers and grass to stop them growing on the road. Nicely done.

Gonzalo Delgado contributed first concept art for the dog, and then a sprite image for the Rogue dog.

H Trayford for the UI display which appears at end of each level added a maximum possible score, which helps the player see how well they did, very helpful.

We shall see all of those in demo.

I added more design tools.
At end-of-level a record of sheep stats including where each one  arrives at bottom of field, is output as a text file.
This is done for the various automated tests of a level, and also for a played level.

Some AI for Hat, to Send a sheep from a specified X value. to help me in a demo to concentrate on voiceover

Keyboard works best, but for touch devices Buttons provided as alternative controls.

Option to replay.

Option to advance to next level font size bigger if score was higher.

Dog if a sheep nearby barks, and if a bit nearer it unsorts the sheep i.e. removes its team colour.

Gonzalo's dog sprite.

iPad and other touch devices, workaround for timing problem with Left and Right buttons.

Phones lose bottom and right side of screen, so temp buttons top left to allow testing.

 designers, some other soundfx, and fixed some bugs.

Let's go to a demo.
