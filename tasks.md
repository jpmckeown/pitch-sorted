demo and roles videos are OK

PITCH:
+ you can do things out of sequence
+ delete space in later weeks
+ describe first week in Trello video
+ sheep sprite equal size head & body
+ when explore attraction pied piper, idea 2-player version, piper for each goal, but halted myself, no dont want to push a player to identify with either goal - the Hat is neutral and wants both lorries loaded. 
+ in Move say considered turn based, gif 1983 game
+ Send is "driving" tho only 1 sheep
+ Faraway tree montage
+ where is my collection HH pics?
+ enlarge Frogger GIF display
+ video of sheep in clamp being painted
+ pitch cover add video of level with all elements OR video of Hat transform sheep
+ mood=Shaun slapstick, wild movement, spinning, visual comedy
+  Theme of people being divided in two categories could be interpreted variously relating to many social phenomena.  the theme of a group being divided into two subgroups could be interpreted in many different ways. Nothing will be said explicitly, leave open to imagination. There are a few clues to my interpretation in game and a few more in code. A good satirist never spells it out.

TRELLO:
+ trello warmup art: 
+ mood = terminology https://theworkingsheepdog.com/
+ mood = countryside pictures
+ portraits: hat, sheep, rogue 
+ expression sheep face

+ mood: Farmageddon "mutton bashing fun" Nintendo Home Sheep Home and 8 web games, https://www.thebigfixup.co.uk/

TASKS:

+ science how sheep distrib in a field, one bunch, not cows
+ book meeting with Level Design trainer
+ how to preserve newline from level editor, research
+ book has spritesheet example 
+ stats for each sheep e.g. tired?

improve Call:
+ call nearest sheep or weight X difference more than Y diff 
+ move diagonally to Hat position instead of directly up
+ update because hat often moves while beckoned sheep moving

+ adjust Drop/Send

+ moving objects need a timer for when/where it appears

MAYBE:
+ how make a tile single-use?

Sorting sheep is tinged with sadness if the sort is for going to market. Later levels bring out the downside of sorting, for example a sheep may be marked with two colours (like Harry Potter being Slytherin) or terrain may change sheep colour, or a sheep may fluctuate between colours.
