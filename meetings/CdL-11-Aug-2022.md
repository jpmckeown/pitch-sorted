T@ function instead of list of states
T@ 2nd grid can be less strict than collision e.g. can pass through but prevent icon stopping on same square (like in a boardgame).
me slow to share screen, and confused
@ font is fuzzy due to browser zooming
@ mouseclick control feels trivial compared to keypress, make Call more like claw (response to my idea of mouse selection of sheep to Call)
@ action points diminish experimental & relaxed
@ phone try whole-screen click
@ buttons on top row become bad if hat gets mouse-control
@ put buttons in column right side beyond grid 
@ yes releasing early to Itch.io is good
@ level designs throwway for 1st quarter of project
@ checklist for each level, be functional before decorative
@ tile variety: pinball only needs 5 things on table
@ conveyorbelt is nice because predictable
@ flowing water?
@ don't leave a Js error message in because contributor may worry that they caused it
