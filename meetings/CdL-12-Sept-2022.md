# 12th September CdL Office-Hours

+ look at canvas in dom inspector

+ unitary canvas better because drag might go across uiBar

+ button bool flip when pressed

+ remember if button pressed in previous interval

+ to send 1 event only, use mouseup instead of mousedown

+ because on touch finger may move between tap down and up , don't look at up coordinate, stroe the down co-ord and use that in down handler (also for mouse)

+ centre-column will look more retro
+ may help player who struggles to judge where

+ don't move level-over info to rightBar, keep on popup but add frame, rounded corners, maybe a PNG background

+ mock up popup elsewhere draggable e.g. Photopea

+ stacked sheep look lost, not as if in goal

+ if 4 mini-sheep looks like maximum 4

+ could move down to make way and popup +1

D+ remove fence from bottom edge

D+ better gameplay if only 1 sheep per goal

+ point score should popup when sheep arrives
