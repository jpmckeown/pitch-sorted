# 4th September CdL Office-Hours

+ wrap mousedown code in a function
+ delete git branch itchio
+ get real phone dimensions e.g. window.innerWidth
+ dynamically resize canvas e.g. APC5
+ whiskers ~ raycast used for point collision detect
+ collision would add replay value because difference each play
+ wider goal suggests easier level, as in SuperMario
+ goals could be in block or individual & spaced
+ CdL does Credits for consistency
+ credits usually read on Itch page; viewer looks for name to verify
+ remove title, animation, margins for Credits page
+ speckled grass, Photopea steps: noise, flood, merge, noncontiguous, posterize, reduce fidelity, random noise?
+ get preferred names of playtesters and if want mention
+ why sheep stop outofplay? water "haha" trench instead of fence
+ speed affects conveyor: feature-lock level parameters
