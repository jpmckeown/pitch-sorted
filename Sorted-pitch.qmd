::: {.notes}
It's my first time pitching a game for Hometeam. Years ago I made a 4-player game called "House-hunting" to help Geography students learn about GIS.

## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle. The player sends a sheep down to the goal but terrain affects movement.

![](img/demo-L4-crop-resize60.png){left=0 top=160 width=600 height=430}

::: {.notes}
The player seeks to get the sheep to move to a goal. First the player calls a sheep up, sorts it to blue or red, and then sends the sheep down aiming for the associated goal. Each level will be designed using terrain tiles which differently affect sheep movement. The genre is comedy puzzle.

## Inspiration

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett ^[https://stone-baked-games.itch.io/one-of-the-herd]

![](GIF/OotH-toPen-ez-optimized.gif){left=0 top=160 width=900 height=501}

::: {.notes}
The game inspiring this project is "One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett. It gives an overhead view, so the hat shows the farmer whose movement is player-controlled and drives the sheep by repelling them.
:::

## Inspiration

![](GIF/hats-title-9s-ezgif.gif){left=0 top=100 width=1024 height=224}

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett

::: {.notes}
Inspirations include that while not being herded the sheep move slightly and sometimes wander. Also that each level gets a fresh set of sheep. The hat influenced the player avatar, and the red and blue coincides with my colour scheme for Sorted.
:::

## Inspiration

![](GIF/scatter-8s-ez-opt-crop.gif){left=0 top=100 width=900 height=452}

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett

::: {.notes}
"One of the Herd" has clever AI so that when repelling sheep if the herder moves too fast or goes too close to the sheep, they scatter sideways. It also has flocking AI between sheep. This game will not attempt to copy that AI realism, so I looked for other ways for a player to influence sheep movement.

## moving down the board

![](img/pigeonhole-1872-small.jpg){.absolute left=0 top=80}

![](img/French-wood-pinball-small.jpg){.absolute left=450 top=80}

![](GIF/Frogger_reaches_goal_flip.gif){.absolute left=40 top=350}

::: {.notes}
I considered attraction, like a Pied Piper of Hamelin, but when combined with a moving herder that made the game too easy. With the hat constrained to the top row I do use attraction for the hat Calling a sheep up to the clamp. Next, how to send a sheep downward? Frogger moves across the game area but is player-controlled, instead the sheep should be indirectly influenced. Some wooden bagatelle boards are vertically inclined and drop a ball down through pins toward pockets or pigeonholes. So that's the send mechanism.
:::

## Inspiration

In sheepdog trials competitors move sheep and do actions with names including "Lift", "Crossdrive", "Shedding", "Singling", and "Penning".

![Shedding from "One man and his dog" BBC TV](GIF/divide_flock_Churchmount_pause.gif){width="567" height="320" fig-align="left"}

::: {.notes}
As for the player purpose and scoring, it's inspired by sheepdog competitions which include actions called "Lift", "Crossdrive", "Shedding" (dividing a flock into two groups), "Singling" (separating one sheep from the flock), and "Penning". As seen on the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog".

## Vision {background-image="img/red_blue_sheep.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
On upland farms you often see sheep painted with different colours: red and blue are seen here. It can signify various things, but one use is after assessing a sheep. For example a farmer will want to identify barren ewes because the infertile cannot stay on the farm and must be separated out. An unrealistic version for the game could be a quality assessment with half qualifying to go to a supermarket, and the other half as mutton for petfood.
:::

## Vision {background-image="img/smart-elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
How is sorting done? One at a time the sheep go into a clamp that holds them steady for assessment and painting. High-end clamps have up and down ramps and that helped inspire the vertical game mechanics call and send.
:::

## Vision {background-image="img/elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="white"}

![](img/sortingHat-removebg.png){.absolute left=-100 top=80 width="225" height="225"}

![](img/red-branding-paint-removebg.png){.absolute left=580 top=500 width="238" height="212"}

::: {.notes}
The player symbolically represents the clamp and the farmer combined. And the player avatar is a Sorting Hat because its role reminds me of sorting a new pupil at Hogwarts School into one of the team houses.

## Vision

![](img/tile_pen_red.png){.absolute left=893 top=382 width=80 height=80}

::: {.notes}
Not enough space on goal tile for lots of sheep to sit, so when next sheep arriving at goal the one already there move up ramp into waiting lorry (off-screen, I think). Then at end of a level the last sheep on goal/ramp goes off-screen, engine noise lorry departs.
:::

## "Am I the ball?" - Vision

![Shaun the Sheep, Aardman Animations, BBC](img/shaun_house_660_319.webp){width=660 height=319 fig-align="left"}

::: {.notes}
A quote in Chris' writings that struck me is "Am I the ball?" it's conventional for the player to identify with the active avatar, here the hat, but sometimes that flips so I identify with the ball or, here, the sheep. Sorted game mechanics will give clues that the sheep don't like being divided. Also the rogue dog (like Bitzer on TV) doesn't want the sheep to leave the farm. 
:::

## Animal Farm - Vision

book by George Orwell, 

and the 2021 Nerial game

![](img/animalfarm-cover.jpg){.absolute top=250 left=0 width=631 height=358}

::: {.notes}
This pitch originated from an earlier game idea called Pigeonhole which featured billiard balls and table pockets, and its theme was putting people into two pigeonholes. Moving to Sorted, when I was exploring pied piper mechanism I considered a 2-player version with a piper for each team but realised no I don't want to push players into identifying with one or other team: the Hat is neutral, it just wants to get both lorries filled. I hope a game can be fun and also a nonverbal allegory open to many different interpretations. An inspiration for that is the recent Animal Farm game based on George Orwell's book.

## Look & Feel

Pace: slow, relaxed

Perspective: 2D, not overhead

Art style: kids cartoon

Palette: fixed 256 colours

![](img/shaun.jpg){.absolute left="55%" top="10%" width="450" height="252"}

::: {.notes}
Relaxed pace, peaceful, 2D.
I looked for a palette with long consolidated ramps for each of primary and secondary colours and chose sonic-robo-blast-2-v22
:::

## Characters

Sorting Hat

Sheep

Rogue (can unSort)

![](img/sortingHat.jpg){.absolute left="40%" top="5%"}

![](img/art_1.jpg){.absolute left="65%" top="15%"}

![](img/bitzer-dog-horror-lighter-small.png){.absolute left="5%" top="44%"
}

::: {.notes}
You play the hat, opponent is the rogue.
For some events or moments in game there will be a contrast between particle fx and sound fx. Particle effects will show the farmer's perspective, and soundfx will show the rogue's perspective. For example when sheep arrives at correct goal, little celebratory particles, and alarmed bleat from sheep.
:::

## Terrain Tiles

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Halt (lake): sheep stops and grazes

Roam (wood): sheep begins wandering/roaming

Deflect (curved path): change direction

Goals (ramps): tinted blue or red

:::

::: {.notes}
Tiles will be named by effect on sheep e.g. Halt, Roam, Deflect, Goal. The art doesn't have to be a lake, wood, etc. But nice to have a story e.g. the lake shore has tasty plants growing which tempt the sheep to stop and graze; in the wood/copse the sheep loses its way and starts roaming. Deflect can be a bending path, maybe has to be followed because in that tile off-path there are thorny brambles.    
:::

## to the Trello!

::: {.notes}
Readme.
guidelines for art, sound, level design, and code. 
 also Tutorial for beginners, more detail than demo, showing player action, effect of different tiles in-game,  Mood board.  in each week a Mix of roles 
two weeks between each level design
Space in later weeks in case I am slower than expected. and conversely Extras in case we progress faster than anticipated.
If you have any queries feel free to message me @Patrick
If something is not here that you would like do to, please ask me to add a card. 
At end: I will update the board weekly.

## Roles needed

Music: gentle

Art: terrain tiles, sheep, rogue

Testing: level completion

VisualFX: e.g. sorting, calling

![](GIF/giphy-leaping-sheep.gif){.absolute left="55%" top="5%"}
![](GIF/giphy-sheep-chewing2.gif){.absolute left="55%" top="40%"}

::: {.notes}
What kind of roles? 
Above all I would like music, ideally two pieces, one that plays over the menu and in-game before sorting starts, and the other after sorting. The first gentle like for example "Sheep May Safely Graze" by JS Bach, the second with edginess, troubled but still gentle. 
Also I am looking for help with art, animation. It would be good to have small particle effects for significant moments such as when a sheep is sorted painted, and when it enters a goal tile.
There are Trello cards for playtesters, please try to break things.
:::

## Roles welcome

Level design: tile placement on grid

SoundFX: e.g. sheep, hat-sorting

Coding: e.g. sheep wander

![](GIF/giphy-talking-sheep.gif){.absolute left="65%" top="5%"}
![](GIF/giphy-sheep-chewing.gif){.absolute left="45%" top="50%"}

::: {.notes}
The code is based on the Classic Games Course following that style which will be familiar. 
Level design covers 1. a tile map (edited with a number grid as in the Classic games), 2. sheep placement (currently each sheep is randomly placed in the top quarter of play area to make Calling easy but they could start anywhere, Perhaps bunched in groups rather than individually scattered), and 3. rogue patrol path. 
SoundFX for UI events such as menu choice can be random sounds from a synthesizer. Other soundFX should be recorded and perhaps filtered. Trello cards give advice or please ask me.
