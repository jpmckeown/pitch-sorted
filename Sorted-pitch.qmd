I have contributed in small ways to 12 HomeTeam games, mostly with sound effects (recorded, filtered, or synthetic), also a few sprites, shapes, and writing.

## About me

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}
My first time pitching a Hometeam game.

::::

::: {.notes}
It's my first time pitching a game for Hometeam. Years ago I made a 4-player game called "House-hunting" to help Geography students learn about GIS.
:::

## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle. The player sends sheep toward 2 pens but terrain affects their movement.

![](img/red_blue_sheep_crop.jpg){left=0 top=160 width=900 height=439}

::: {.notes}
In the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog" competitors move sheep around obstacles and into a pen. Sorted is a bit like that. Each level will have a map designed with terrain tiles which differently affect sheep movement. The game genre is comedy puzzle.

## Inspiration

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett ^[https://stone-baked-games.itch.io/one-of-the-herd]

![](GIF/OotH-toPen-ez-optimized.gif){left=0 top=160 width=600 height=334}

::: {.notes}
The game inspiring this is "One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett. It's an overhead view, the hat shows the farmer whose movement drives the sheep by a repelling them.
:::

## Inspiration

![](GIF/hats-title-9s-ezgif.gif){left=0 top=100 width=1024 height=218}

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett

::: {.notes}
Inspirations include that when not herded sheep wander, and each level gets a fresh set of sheep. And the red and blue hats which I echo in colour scheme of Sorted.
:::

## Inspiration

![](GIF/scatter-8s-ez-opt-crop.gif){left=0 top=100 width=600 height=301}

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett

::: {.notes}
"One of the Herd" AI when repelling sheep means if the herder moves too fast or too close to the sheep they scatter sideways. It also has flocking AI between sheep. This game will not attempt that AI realism, beyond my ability, so I looked for other ways to move the sheep.

## moving down the board

![](img/pigeonhole-1872-small.jpg){.absolute left=0 top=80}

![](img/French-wood-pinball-small.jpg){.absolute left=450 top=80}

![](GIF/Frogger_reaches_goal_flip.gif){.absolute left=40 top=350}

::: {.notes}
I considered attraction, like a Pied Piper of Hamelin. When combined with a moving herder that made it too easy, but I do use it for the Call action of the game. Then how to move sheep? Some wooden bagatelle boards are vertically inclined and drop a ball down through pins. Frogger moves from one side of the screen to the other aiming for a goal tile. So that's movement.

## Vision

Sheepdog trials competition terminology "Lift", "Crossdrive", "Shedding", "Singling", "Penning".

!["One man and his dog" BBC](GIF/divide_flock_Churchmount_pause.gif){width="567" height="320"}

::: {.notes}
As for game goal and scoring, it's inspired by herding competitions which include exercises called "Lift", "Crossdrive", "Singling" (separating one sheep from the flock), "Shedding" (dividing a flock into two groups) and "Penning".
:::

## Vision {background-image="img/red_blue_sheep.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
On upland farms you often see sheep painted with different colours: red and blueare seen here. It can signify various things, but one use is after assessing a sheep's quality. For example a farmer wants to identify ewes as fertile or barren because the infertile cannot stay on the farm and will be sold.
:::

## Vision {background-image="img/smart-elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
How is the sorting done? One at a time, to be assessed and painted, sheep go into a clamp that holds them steady. High-end clamps have up and down ramps and that also inspired the game mechanics.
:::

## Vision {background-image="img/elevated-clamp.jpg"}

![](img/sortingHat-removebg.png){.absolute left=-100 top=80 width="225" height="225"}

![](img/red-branding-paint.jpg){.absolute left=1040 top=50 width="238" height="212"}

::: {.notes}
The player's icon symbolically represents the clamp and farmer combined. It's a sorting hat because it reminds me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into one of the team houses.
:::

## "Am I the ball?"

![](img/shaun_house_660_319.webp){.absolute top=100 left=0 width=660 height=319}

::: {.notes}
A quote in Chris' writings that struck me is "Am I the ball?" it's conventional for the player to identify with the active avatar, here the hat, but sometimes that flips so I identify with the ball or, here, the sheep. Sorted game mechanics will give clues that the sheep don't like being divided, and don't want to leave the farm - and the rogue dog agrees. 
:::

## Animal Farm 

book by George Orwell, 

and the 2021 Nerial game

![](img/animalfarm-cover.jpg){.absolute top=250 left=0 width=631 height=358}

::: {.notes}
This pitch mutated from an earlier game idea called Pigeonhole which featured billiard balls and table pockets, and its theme was pigeonholing in human relations. I hope a game can be fun and also a nonverbal allegory. An inspiration for that is the recent Animal Farm game based on George Orwell's book.

## Game Vision & Look

Pace: slow, relaxed

Perspective: overhead 2D

Art style: kids cartoon

Palette: fixed 256 colours

![](img/shaun.jpg){.absolute left="55%" top="10%" width="299" height="168"}

::: {.notes}
Relaxed pace, peaceful, overhead 2D.
I looked for a palette with long consolidated ramps for each of primary and secondary colours and chose sonic-robo-blast-2-v22

## Roles needed

Music: rural relaxed

Testing: level progress

Art: terrain tiles, sheep

VisualFX: e.g. sorting, calling

::: {.notes}
I am especially looking for help with music, art, and playtesting.
:::

## Roles welcome

Level design: tile grid, rogues placement

SoundFX: e.g. sheep, hat-sorting

Coding: e.g. sheep wander

::: {.notes}
The code is based on the Classic Games Course following that style which will be familiar. SoundFX can be recorded or synthesised. Level design and editing is done through a number grid as in the Classic games. Trello cards give advice or please ask me.
