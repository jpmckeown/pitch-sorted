## Introduction {.scrollable}

"Sorted" is a puzzle game with many levels. Sheep are lifted up to the player avatar (a hat) and sorted into two groups by applying paint. The main mechanism sends a sheep to move across terrain (which has various effects) towards the correct pen, like in the BBC program "One Man and His Dog".

Early levels are simple, and the game is relaxed.

The code is built on Chris's Javascript tutorials.
