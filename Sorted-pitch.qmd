## Prototype

## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle game. The shepherd player wants sheep to reach their pen - like in the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog". Each level will have a tiled map design choosing from a dozen terrain types which affect sheep movement. Plan is for nine levels. Early levels are simple and serve as tutorial. The game is relaxed.

Art: kids cartoon style

Palette: sonic-robo-blast-2-v22

## Schedule overview

Week : level editor usable

Week : level 9 completed

Weeks : playtesting

Weeks : polishing and bug-fixing

## Trello board

## Level design roles

Level editing currently via number grid (like in Classic games)

Aiming for 9 levels

## Art roles

Sorting hat

Terrain tiles

## Visual fx roles

Sorting process (mystical & disorienting)

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

## Music roles

Placeholder music is "Sheep may safely graze" by JS Bach. This plays during menu and before sorting. 

When sorting begins a switch to different music with a slightly ominous tone would be helpful.

## Sound fx roles

Cartoon style e.g. Shaun the Sheep

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

Sorting

Drop

Moving into terrain 



## Code roles

The prototype is built on Chris DeLeon's Javascript tutorials, and will keep to that code style.

## Testing roles

Later levels especially need testing to see if they can be completed fairly easily.
