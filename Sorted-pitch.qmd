## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle game. Each level has a tiled map designed using terrain types which differently affect sheep movement. The game is relaxed.

## Inspirations

"One Man and His Dog"

![](video/1MahD-4-Pen-Trim.mp4){.absolute left=0 top=170 width=800 height=450}

::: {.notes}
In the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog" the competitors move a flock of sheep around obstacles and finally into a pen.

## "One of the Herd"

by Tim Waskett ^[https://stone-baked-games.itch.io/one-of-the-herd]

![](GIF/ezgif_OneOfTheHerd_Level_3.gif){.absolute left=0 top=200 width=600 height=338}

::: {.notes}
Demo: overhead 2D view, each level gets fresh set of sheep, minimal violence. In One of the Herd clever algorithms for sheep being repelled by herder so if you move too fast or too close they scatter. Also flocking between sheep. Sorted game won't attempt that realism, looking for other mechanisms.
:::


## Inspiration {background-image="img/red_blue_sheep.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
On upland farms you often see sheep painted with different colours. This can signify various things, but one use is after assessing a sheep's quality. For example a farmer wants to identify ewes as fertile or barren. The infertile cannot stay in the flock and will be sold.
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/smart-elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
One at a time, to be assessed and painted sheep will go up into a clamp that holds them steady. High-end clamps have up and down ramps and this inspired the game mechanics beckon, paint, and drop.
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/elevated-clamp.jpg"}

![](img/sortingHat.jpg){.absolute left=920 top=480 width="225" height="225"}

::: {.notes}
The player's icon symbolically represents the clamp and farmer combined. Placeholder art is a Sorting Hat because it reminds me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into one of the team houses.

## Level design roles

Level editing currently via number grid (like in Classic games)

Aiming for 9 levels

::: {.notes}
:::

## Art roles

Sorting hat

Terrain tiles

## Visual fx roles

Sorting process (mystical & disorienting)

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

## Music roles


When sorting begins a switch to different music with a slightly ominous tone would be helpful.

## Sound fx roles

Cartoon style e.g. Shaun the Sheep

Beckon (sheep brought up to hat)

Sorting

Drop

Moving into terrain

::: {.notes}
:::

## Code roles

The prototype is built on Chris DeLeon's Javascript tutorials, and will keep to that code style.

## Testing roles

Later levels especially need testing to see if they can be completed fairly easily.
