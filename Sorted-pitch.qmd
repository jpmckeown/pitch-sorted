## About me

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}
My first time pitching a Hometeam game.

::: {.notes}
It's my first time pitching a game for Hometeam. Years ago I made a 4-player game called "House-hunting" to help Geography students learn about GIS.

## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle. The player calls one sheep then sends it down aiming for one of the two goals, but terrain affects their movement.

![](img/demo-L4-crop-resize60.png){left=0 top=160 width=600 height=430}

::: {.notes}
The player seeks to get the sheep to move to a goal. First the player calls a sheep up, sorts it to blue or red, and then sends the sheep down aiming for the associated goal. Each level will be designed using terrain tiles which differently affect sheep movement. The genre is comedy puzzle.

## Inspiration

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett ^[https://stone-baked-games.itch.io/one-of-the-herd]

![](GIF/OotH-toPen-ez-optimized.gif){left=0 top=160 width=600 height=334}

::: {.notes}
The game inspiring this project is "One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett. It gives an overhead view, so the hat shows the farmer whose movement is player-controlled and drives the sheep by repelling them.
:::

## Inspiration

![](GIF/hats-title-9s-ezgif.gif){left=0 top=100 width=1024 height=218}

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett

::: {.notes}
Inspirations include that when not being herded the sheep move slightly and sometimes wander. Also that each level gets a fresh set of sheep. And the red and blue hats I echo in the colour scheme for Sorted.
:::

## Inspiration

![](GIF/scatter-8s-ez-opt-crop.gif){left=0 top=100 width=600 height=301}

"One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett

::: {.notes}
"One of the Herd" has clever AI so that when repelling sheep if the herder moves too fast or goes too close to the sheep, they scatter sideways. It also has flocking AI between sheep. This game will not attempt to copy that AI realism, so I looked for other ways for a player to influence sheep movement.

## moving down the board

![](img/French-wood-pinball-small.jpg){.absolute left=450 top=80}

![](GIF/Frogger_reaches_goal_flip.gif){.absolute left=40 top=350}

::: {.notes}
I considered attraction, like a Pied Piper of Hamelin, but when combined with a moving herder that made the game too easy. With the hat constrained to the top row I do use attraction for the hat Calling a sheep up to the clamp. Next, how to send a sheep downward? Frogger moves across the game area but is player-controlled, instead the sheep should be indirectly influenced. Some wooden bagatelle boards are vertically inclined and drop a ball down through pins toward pockets or pigeonholes. So that's the send mechanism.
:::

## Inspiration

In sheepdog trials competitors move sheep and do actions with names including "Lift", "Crossdrive", "Shedding", "Singling", and "Penning".

![Shedding from "One man and his dog" BBC TV](GIF/divide_flock_Churchmount_pause.gif){width="567" height="320" fig-align="left"}

::: {.notes}
As for the player purpose and scoring, it's inspired by sheepdog competitions which include actions called "Lift", "Crossdrive", "Shedding" (dividing a flock into two groups), "Singling" (separating one sheep from the flock), and "Penning". As seen on the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog".

## Vision {background-image="img/red_blue_sheep.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
On upland farms you often see sheep painted with different colours: red and blue are seen here. It can signify various things, but one use is after assessing a sheep. For example a farmer will want to identify barren ewes because the infertile cannot stay on the farm and must be separated out. But for an unrealistic comedy version imagine a quality assessment and while half are good for lamb chops, the other half are mutton.
:::

## Vision {background-image="img/smart-elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
How is the sorting done? One at a time, to be assessed and painted, sheep go into a clamp that holds them steady. High-end clamps have up and down ramps and that also inspired the game mechanics.
:::

![](img/red-branding-paint-removebg.png){.absolute left=580 top=500 width="238" height="212"}

::: {.notes}
The player's icon symbolically represents the clamp and farmer combined. It's a Sorting Hat because it reminds me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into one of the team houses.

## "Am I the ball?" - Vision

![Shaun the Sheep, Aardman Animations, BBC](img/shaun_house_660_319.webp){width=660 height=319 fig-align="left"}

::: {.notes}
A quote in Chris' writings that struck me is "Am I the ball?" it's conventional for the player to identify with the active avatar, here the hat, but sometimes that flips so I identify with the ball or, here, the sheep. Sorted game mechanics will give clues that the sheep don't like being divided, and don't want to leave the farm - and the rogue dog agrees.

## Animal Farm - Vision

book by George Orwell, 

and the 2021 Nerial game

![](img/animalfarm-cover.jpg){.absolute top=250 left=0 width=631 height=358}

::: {.notes}
This pitch originated from an earlier game idea called Pigeonwhole which featured billiard balls and table pockets, and its theme was human relations, the pigeonholing of people. I hope a game can be fun and also a nonverbal allegory. An inspiration for that is the recent Animal Farm game based on George Orwell's book.

## Roles needed

Music: rural relaxed

Testing: level progress

Art: terrain tiles, sheep

VisualFX: e.g. sorting, calling

::: {.notes}
I am especially looking for help with music, art, and playtesting.
:::

## Roles welcome

Level design: tile grid, rogue placement

SoundFX: e.g. sheep, hat-sorting

Coding: e.g. sheep wander

::: {.notes}
The code is based on the Classic Games Course following that style which will be familiar. SoundFX can be recorded or synthesised. Level design and editing is done through a number grid as in the Classic games. Trello cards give advice or please ask me.
