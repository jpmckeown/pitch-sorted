## About me

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
My first time pitching a Hometeam game.

This is my first time pitching a game for Hometeam. Years ago I made a 4-player computerised game called "House-hunting" to help Geography students learn about GIS.

## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle game. The player sends sheep toward a pen, and terrain affects their movement.

::: {.notes}
In the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog" competitors move sheep around obstacles and into a pen. Sorted is a bit like that. Each level will have a map designed with terrain tiles which differently affect sheep movement. The game genre is comedy puzzle, and relaxed.
:::

## Vision - sheepdog competition

"Lift", "Crossdrive", "Shedding" and "Singling", "Penning" 

!["One man and his dog" BBC](GIF/divide_flock_Churchmount_pause.gif){width="567" height="320"}

::: {.notes}
What inspired this game pitch? Some sections of herding competitions called "Lift", "Crossdrive", "Singling", and "Penning". shedding sorts sheep into two separate groups. 
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/red_blue_sheep.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
On upland farms you often see sheep painted with different colours. It can signify various things, but one use is after assessing a sheep's quality. For example a farmer wants to identify ewes as fertile or barren. The infertile cannot stay in the flock and will be sold.
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/smart-elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
One at a time, to be assessed and painted sheep will go up into a clamp that holds them steady. High-end clamps have up and down ramps and that inspired this game's mechanics call, paint, drop and send.
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/elevated-clamp.jpg"}

![](img/sortingHat-removebg.png){.absolute left=-100 top=80 width="225" height="225"}

![](img/red-branding-paint.jpg){.absolute left=1040 top=50 width="238" height="212"}

::: {.notes}
The player's icon symbolically represents the clamp and the farmer combined. The placeholder art is a Sorting Hat because it reminds me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into one of the team houses.
:::

## Inspiration - "One of the Herd"

by Tim Waskett ^[https://stone-baked-games.itch.io/one-of-the-herd]

![](GIF/ezgif_OneOfTheHerd_Level_3.gif){.absolute left=0 top=200 width=600 height=338}

::: {.notes}
The videogame inspiring this is "One of the Herd" by Tim Waskett. overhead view, the blue hat is the farmer, and his movement drives the sheep. Inspirations inlcude sheep wandering when not herded, each level gets fresh set of sheep, peaceful (except when sheep touch electric fence and explode). One of the Herd has clever algorithms for sheep being repelled away from herder so if you move too fast or too close they scatter to the sides. It also has flocking AI between sheep. Sorted won't attempt that realism, so I looked for other mechanisms.

## moving down the board

![](img/pigeonhole-1872-small.jpg){.absolute left=0 top=80}

![](img/French-wood-pinball-small.jpg){.absolute left=450 top=80}

![](GIF/Frogger_reaches_goal_flip.gif){.absolute left=40 top=350}

::: {.notes}
Some wooden bagatelle boards are vertically inclined and drop a ball down through pins. Frogger moves from one side of the screen to the other aiming for a goal tile. Sorted uses that idea.
:::

## "Am I the ball?"

![](img/shaun_house_660_319.webp){.absolute top=100 left=0 width=660 height=319}

::: {.notes}
A quote in Chris' writings that struck me is "Am I the ball?" it's conventional for the player to identify with the active avatar e.g. the paddle or the hat, but sometimes I may identify with the ball or sheep. Sorted will give hints, especially in soundfx, that the sheep don't want to leave the farm. 
:::

## Animal Farm 

book by George Orwell, 

and the 2021 Nerial game

![](img/animalfarm-cover.jpg){.absolute top=250 left=0 width=631 height=358}

::: {.notes}
This pitch mutated from an earlier game idea called Pigeonhole featuring balls, and its theme was pigeonholing in human relations. I hope a fun game can also be a silent parable. An inspiration for that is the Animal Farm game based on George Orwell's book.

## Game Vision & Look

Pace: slow, relaxed

Perspective: overhead 2D

Art style: kids cartoon

Palette: fixed 256 colours

![](img/shaun.jpg){.absolute left="55%" top="10%" width="299" height="168"}

::: {.notes}
Relaxed pace, peaceful, overhead 2D.
I looked for a palette with long consolidated ramps for each of primary and secondary colours and chose sonic-robo-blast-2-v22

## Roles needed

Music: rural relaxed

Testing: level progress

Art: terrain tiles, sheep

VisualFX: e.g. sorting, calling

::: {.notes}
I am especially looking for help with music, art, and playtesting.
:::

## Roles welcome

Level design: tile grid, rogues placement

SoundFX: e.g. sheep, hat-sorting

Coding: e.g. sheep wander

::: {.notes}
The code is based on the Classic Games Course following that style which will be familiar. SoundFX can be recorded or synthesised. Level design and editing is done through a number grid as in the Classic games. Trello cards give advice or please ask me.
