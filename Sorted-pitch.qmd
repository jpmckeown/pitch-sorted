## Overview

"Sorted" is a comedy puzzle game. The player tries to move sheep into a holding pen, and terrain tiles affect movement of the sheep.

::: {.notes}
In the BBC TV program "One Man and His Dog" competitors move sheep around obstacles and into a pen. Sorted is a bit like that. Each level will have a map designed using terrain tiles which differently affect sheep movement. The game genre is comedy puzzle, and relaxed.

## "One of the Herd"

by Tim Waskett ^[https://stone-baked-games.itch.io/one-of-the-herd]

![](GIF/ezgif_OneOfTheHerd_Level_3.gif){.absolute left=0 top=200 width=600 height=338}

::: {.notes}
Demo: overhead 2D view, occasional wandering, each level gets fresh set of sheep, peaceful minimal violence. Not imitating One of the Herd clever algorithms for sheep being repelled by herder so if you move too fast or too close they scatter. Also flocking between sheep. Sorted game won't attempt imitate that realism, so looking for other mechanisms.
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/red_blue_sheep.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
On upland farms you often see sheep painted with different colours. It can signify various things, but one use is after assessing a sheep's quality. For example a farmer wants to identify ewes as fertile or barren. The infertile cannot stay in the flock and will be sold.
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/smart-elevated-clamp.jpg" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
One at a time, to be assessed and painted sheep will go up into a clamp that holds them steady. High-end clamps have up and down ramps and this inspired the game mechanics beckon, paint, and drop.
:::

## Inspiration {background-image="img/elevated-clamp.jpg"}

![](img/sortingHat.jpg){.absolute left=920 top=480 width="225" height="225"}

::: {.notes}
The player's icon symbolically represents the clamp and the farmer combined. The placeholder art is a Sorting Hat because it reminds me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into one of the team houses.
:::

## "Am I the ball?"

::: {.notes}
A quote in Chris' writings that strick me, conventional for player to identify with active avatar e.g. the paddle or hat, but by end player maybe identifies with ball or sheep. The game will give hints, especially in soundfx, that the sheep don't want to leave the farm.

## "Animal Farm" 

book by George Orwell, 

and the 2021 Nerial game

![](img/animalfarm-cover.jpg){.absolute top=100 left=0 width=631 height=358}

::: {.notes}
Earlier idea for a game was called Pigeonhole, with balls not sheep, and its theme was pigeonholing in human social relations. My aim is for a fun game that is also a silent parable, and an inspiration for that is the Animal Farm game based on George Orwell's book.
