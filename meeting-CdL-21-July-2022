P: inspired by One of the Herd (OotH); mechanisms to move sheep, repel and flocking well done in OotH so considering attract (Pied Piper), launch with angle, and drop vertically after sliding horizontally.

C: affect move e.g. conveyor-belt, Frogger, Lemmings, Paggle.
a tile that disappears once used e.g. flower.
X if moving objects need a timer for when/where it appears.

C: sprite sheets example put all art in one image strip.
sprites help show mood emotion of sheep.

C: if pace control by turns or other things only moving after player move tends to force efficiency on player, reduces experimental moving.
Alternative is that using extra time/steps is only slightly penalised e.g in Kenyon pizza delivery a few slices are lost as jounrney goes on.

C: hat & piper risks being 2 separate games.

C: prepare = video, genre, list enemies or obstacles e.g. tiles.  

C: colour change OK if player still accountable?
maybe timed flicker to different colour.

C: state, save level state before menu?

C: at least 1 art to set style and palette.

P: watch Frogger, has 5 lanes of traffic danger moving alternate directions and speed varies betwen lanes, then safe area (but snake can go here), then a river of danger with 5 moving conveyors in alternating directions and as much gaps as island-supports, and some crocodiles. Aiming for 1 of 5 riverbank homes (indented empty space).

? would any moving tile make sense? river & things floating down river, road & traffic, wolf danger, piper attract, 

P: watch Peggle, dotted line aim, then ball bounces off pegs.

P: meeting protocol = share screen not window, ensure debugger shows error.
