# Leading
don't alter a contribution, ask them to change it and explain how

Update videos
+ use on-screen keyboard (also for tutorial)
+ make quarto template Title + Contribution page
+ audio player on slide (like W&G2)

Trello
+ label not designed yet (ask me first) yellow
+ backward plan from end target
+ mini GIFs or images in a grid e.g. 2 rows (see Eden Sky)
+ narrative & cutscenes = one category?

Pitch
multiple small gifs in rectangle on same screen

Production
+ modular levels
+ sound for every event
+ up to you but helpful please upload production file e.g. Aseprite, Audacity
