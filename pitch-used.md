One of the Herd
grazing and wandering sheep, new level with fresh set of sheep, overhead 2D view, minimal violence.
Sorted differs: not attempting flocking AI, not copying realistic mechanism i.e. moving herder (dog or human) repels sheep.

About me
Years ago I made a 4-player "House-hunting game" to help Geography students lean about GIS. MMy day-job since April has been looking for a job.
: HHG imagery

Overview
Peaceful game, or at least no violence on screen.

Inspiration: 
On upland farms you see sheep painted with different colours. These can signify various things, but one use is when assessing a sheep's quality. For example a shepherd will want to identify ewes as fertile or barren. The infertile cannot stay in the flock and will be sold.

During assessment sheep are kept steady by going in a clamp, one at a time. High-end clamps are elevated and this inspired a game feature. The player icon symbolically represents the clamp and shepherd combined. Sheep are assigned to one of two categories, and then drop down to walk to the appropriate one of two pens.

Placeholder art for the player icon is a Sorting Hat because it reminded me of sorting a Hogwarts pupil into a house. The player must align with sheep to beckon, then choose where to drop. Aim for correct pen but some terrain tiles will influence the sheep. Once all sheep are sorted and penned the next level begins with new sheep on different map.    

 or into a lorry or a truck. Once rightly penned they are "sorted".

 + Shrek onion gif. Polyvalence Early version was call pigeonhole and balls not sheep theme pigeonholing people into categories, divide peopl into categ, but can play the game for fun without realising any meaning. Insp layers AF really is about farm e g seasonal cycle agri with harsh winter. And also a social parable

## Notes from slides

## Levels

Menu: animation hat pulls and sorts meeple, sends off diagonally

1: hat & 1 meeple only, drop to fall into pen (or try again)

2: hat & many meeples, pull & drop, score (progress when all sorted)

3: add 1 tutor, drop part-way, herd (attract by proximity)

4: add 2nd tutor, same mechanism but each only does one colour

5: add meeple random walk slow rare

6: add terrain, obstacles, deflectors, powerups

7: increase meeple random walk frequency

8: some sorting by Hat produces mixed meeples 

If a level is replayed mixed meeples appear.

How will it remember between games (keep record on device) or add mixed meeples from L3 onward.

first tutor is purple or striped blue/red

## Components

Brick = edge bounce, scoring,

Cars = goal detect, class, friction, facing/angle

Warrior = tutor move, 

Space = wandering AI, collision between objects

RTS = gotoXY, connector lines
Plan is for nine levels. Early levels are simple and serve as tutorial. 

Done
